        <h3>AI Agent Recruiter Outreach Automation</h3>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In today’s fast-paced eCommerce industry, data analytics is crucial for making informed decisions. 
            I took on the challenge of analyzing an Ecommerce Sales Platform using Power BI, with the goal of 
            uncovering valuable insights and presenting them in an easy-to-understand, interactive dashboard.
            This project highlights my skills in data visualization, data analysis, and dashboard design, as 
            well as my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.</p>


        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>Analyze sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior to identify key drivers of growth.</li>
            <li>Explore product categories, states, and payment modes to optimize business strategies.</li>
            <li>Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable real-time filtering and dynamic exploration of metrics.</li>
          </ul>   


        <h2>Data Analysis and Key Insights</h2> 
        <h4>Sales Performance & Profitability</h4>      
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>The total sales revenue for the period was ₹438,000, with a total profit of ₹37,000. Sales were highest in the fourth quarter, particularly in December, due to holiday shopping. However, there was a noticeable drop in sales during June and July, indicating a seasonal slowdown in the middle of the year.0</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Customer Behavior & Product Categories</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>In terms of customer behavior and product categories, clothing made up the majority of items sold at 63%, followed by electronics at 21% and furniture at 17%. Among subcategories, printers and bookcases were the most profitable. Key customers like Harivansh, Madhav, and Madan Mohan contributed significantly to the overall revenue.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Regional Sales Distribution</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>Regionally, Maharashtra was the top-performing state, with Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh following closely behind. Analyzing sales by state helped identify potential areas for market growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Payment Mode Preferences</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>When it comes to payment preferences, Cash on Delivery (COD) was the most popular method, accounting for 44% of transactions, followed by UPI at 21% and debit/credit cards. This information is useful for shaping marketing strategies and improving payment options for customers.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
